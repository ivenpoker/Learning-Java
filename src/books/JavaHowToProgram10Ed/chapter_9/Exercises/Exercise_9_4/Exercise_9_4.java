    // ANS:
    // Software reuse:
    //     By inheriting functionalities from another class, we don't get to re-implement
    //     the logic and complexities associated with the class design.
    //
    // Saves Time:
    //     Most classes in the Core Java API, handle some complexities for us. Inheritance
    //     saves us the time, which could have been used to re-implement and design the classes
    //     as we could just inherit the existing functionalities and just continue from there.
    //
    // Prevent Errors:
    //     Copy and pasting code from one class to another is error prone, and provides a
    //     maintenance 'hell'. Also if a copied code has a major bug, we'll need to track down
    //     all the places where the code was pasted and fixed it, whereas if we use inheritance,
    //     there will be just one central location for the code, where we can now fix the bug.
