        // ANS:
        //
        // a) It means to choose a number based on some unpredictable pattern, in
        //    which ... the means, manner, pattern or algorithm used to obtained the the number cannot be figured out.
        //    In other words, reverse engineering isn't possible.
        //
        // b) This is because 'game of chance' is based generating random numbers within a specified range.
        //    And the range of numbers on which the 'game of chance' operates, is obtainable via 'nextInt' method.
        //    Hence the method is just perfect for this purpose.
        //
        // c) To obtain random data within a desired range.
        // d) This helps us (Programmers) to assert that our algorithms is working
        //    as desired, since the data which is obtained through random generation
        //    is not predefined by us. In a nutshell, it is ideal for testing purposes and to find
        //    bugs.
